<br />
Despite the growing demand for professional graphic design knowledge, the tacit nature of design inhibits knowledge sharing. However, there is a limited understanding on the characteristics and instances of tacit knowledge in graphic design. In this work, we build a comprehensive set of tacit knowledge characteristics through a literature review. Through interviews with 10 professional graphic designers, we collected 123 tacit knowledge instances and labeled their characteristics. By qualitatively coding the instances, we identified the prominent elements, actions, and purposes of tacit knowledge. To identify which instances have been addressed the least, we conducted a systematic literature review of prior system support to graphic design. By understanding the reasons for the lack of support on these instances based on their characteristics, we propose design guidelines for capturing and applying tacit knowledge in design tools. This work takes a step towards understanding tacit knowledge, and how this knowledge can be communicated.

<h2 id="method-overview-and-research-questions"><span class="highlight">Method Overview and Research Questions</span></h2>

<p>Our study aims to investigate tacit knowledge in graphic design deeply by identifying the characteristics and instances of tacit knowledge, as well as by reviewing prior approaches for supporting the usage of design knowledge. The ultimate goal is to propose design guidelines for systems that support the capture and application of tacit knowledge. Based on these research goals, we defined three research questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><span class="highlight">RQ1.</span>:</strong> What types of tacit knowledge <strong>instances</strong> exist in graphic design, and what are the differences between these types regarding their <strong>characteristics</strong>?</li>
  <li><strong><span class="highlight">RQ2</span>:</strong> How do prior <strong>approaches</strong> in graphic design support the usage of tacit knowledge <strong>instances</strong>, and what parts lack support?</li>
  <li><strong><span class="highlight">RQ3</span>:</strong> How should tools that support the sharing, communicating, and using tacit knowledge be designed?</li>
</ul>

<p>The below table shows the terms and their definitions used in this paper.</p>

<h2 id="compiling-characteristics-of-tacit-knowledge-through-a-literature-review"><span class="highlight">Compiling Characteristics of Tacit Knowledge Through a Literature Review</span></h2>

<p>According to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789814295505_0013">Leonard and Sensiper (1998)</a>, knowledge exists on a spectrum from tacit and unconscious knowledge to explicit and codified knowledge. The majority of knowledge falls somewhere in this knowledge spectrum. This can be interpreted as having varying degrees of tacitness (<a href="https://compositionforum.com/issue/49/discourse-based-interview-print.pdf">Lee et al., 1983;</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537329608524237">Jeremy, 1996</a>) depending on how difficult it is to share and communicate. Hence, identifying the characteristics of each tacit knowledge has to be the first step to understanding it deeply.</p>

<p>While prior work has described some of the characteristics, to the best of our knowledge, <span class="lacking">no study has provided a comprehensive list with the described characteristics from prior work</span>. In this background, we first assembled and organized the characteristics defined in prior work through a literature survey.</p>

<p class="sys-img"><img src="/assets/img/characteristics.png" alt="A table shows the result of the literature review on tacit knowledge. The category characteristics and paper of the tacit knowledge are illustrated. There are four categories, and 14 characteristic codes are shown in the table. In category, possession, expression, acquisition, and manifestation exist." /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="interview-study-with-professional-graphic-designers"><span class="highlight">Interview Study with Professional Graphic Designers</span></h2>

<p>To identify concrete instances of tacit knowledge in the graphic design domain and understand what characteristics these instances possess, we conducted an <span class="highlight2">interview study with 10 graphic design experts</span>. Through the study, we collected <span class="highlight2">123 instances of tacit knowledge</span>. Then, we analyzed how tacit knowledge is manifested in graphic design by performing a qualitative coding of the collected instances according to the element where the tacit knowledge is revealed, the action taken by the knowledge subject to use the tacit knowledge, and the purpose of using that knowledge.</p>

<p class="sys-img"><img src="/assets/img/instances.png" alt="Table 3 shows the code and category of tacit knowledge in graphic design. Since our qualitative coding was conducted regarding the instanceâ€™s element, action, and purpose, three coding schemes are on the left side. Then, the category, code, code count, and category count are shown. There are five categories (inner design element, design work pattern, contents, outer design source, and overall) in element, three categories (cognition, utilization, and manipulation) in action, and seven categories (environment, audience, visual, individual design style, design contents, and empty) in purpose. The highest number of categories is colored green, and the lowest number of categories is colored red." /></p>

<h2 id="systematic-literature-review-exploring-graphic-design-approaches"><span class="highlight">Systematic Literature Review: Exploring Graphic Design Approaches</span></h2>

<p>To investigate gaps between the investigated instances and the prior approaches that support the graphic design process (e.g., design creation, knowledge sharing, etc.), we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on approaches, encompassing systems, techniques, and methodologies related to graphic design. By annotating the elements, actions, and purposes of instances supported explicitly by the approach, we investigate how existing approaches address different types of tacit knowledge in graphic design. This SLR aims to uncover what categories or codes of tacit knowledge instances remain unsupported or under-supported and to analyze the reasons through the characteristics of tacit knowledge.</p>

<p class="sys-img"><img src="/assets/img/approaches.png" alt="Table 4 shows the annotation results of our systematic literature review. The qualitative coding results are namely as shown in Table 3 same. The right side columns show the prior approaches that were annotated to this code with the average ratio of approaches in the category level. The highest number of categories is colored green, and the lowest number of categories is colored red." /></p>

<h2 id="design-guidelines-for-capturing-and-applying-tacit-design-knowledge"><span class="highlight">Design Guidelines for Capturing and Applying Tacit Design Knowledge</span></h2>

<p>we propose two sets of design guidelines: 1. to capture tacit knowledge from experienced designers, and 2. to support those that lack the knowledge in applying it in their own design processes. Specifically, we aim to provide guidelines aligned with contemporary graphic design practices, predominantly conducted on web and app-based design tools or systems.</p>

<p>The guidelines are designed based on the main findings of the study.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graphic designers primarily use tacit knowledge by doing manipulation- and cognition-related <em>actions</em> on inner design <em>elements</em> with the <em>purposes</em> of creating visually pleasing artifacts and satisfying the potential audience.</li>
  <li>Graphic design tacit knowledge is acquired through experience and practice (learning-by-doing) and is influenced by personal traits, intuition, and context. However, it can be adequately reasoned about, communicated, and expressed through non-verbal channels like design actions.</li>
  <li>Prior approaches have shown low coverage for the <em>elements</em> (contents/inner-design elements), <em>actions</em> (cognition/manipulation), and <em>purposes</em> (visual/audience) of tacit knowledge because this knowledge is more associated with personal intuition and is more specific to the context.</li>

<h2 id="-conclusion-"><span class="highlight"> Conclusion </span></h2>

<p>This work investigates the tacit knowledge in graphic design by identifying the instances, characteristics, and prior approaches. Through the interview and annotation study with professional graphic designers, this study proposes specific elements, actions, and purposes of tacit knowledge instances in graphic design with their characteristics. Also, systematic literature review and annotation process reveal the less covered elements, actions, and purposes of tacit knowledge by prior approaches that support the graphic design process. Finally, this study proposes design guidelines to capture and support the application of tacit knowledge, considering the characteristics of the instances in graphic design. Our work contributes to the future where tacit knowledge could be actively shared by demystifying tacit knowledge in graphic design.</p>

When the user clicks this button, the generation panel pops out below; (e) Show more button: This button is clicked when the user wants to see more search results.](/assets/img/interface.png)

<span class="sys-name">ðŸ”® GenQuery</span> provides a similar interface to popular visual search tools like [Pinterest](https://co.pinterest.com/). The system provides a similar interface to popular visual search tools like Pinterest. Users can input a text query <span class="highlight">[a]</span> (text-based search) or click an image in the search results <span class="highlight">[b]</span> (image-based search) to find the visual images they want to see and save the desired images <span class="highlight">[c]</span>.

Beyond these basic features, <span class="sys-name">GenQuery</span> supports **<a href="#QC" target="_self">Query Concretization</a>** when the user writes a query in <span class="highlight">[a]</span>. Furthermore, when the user clicks <span class="highlight">[d]</span>, it also supports **<a href="#IM" target="_self">Image-based Image Modification</a>** and **<a href="#KM" target="_self">Keyword-based Image Modification</a>** to allow the user to find more intent-aligned or diversified images.

<br/>

### <span id="QC" class="sys-name">Query Concretization</span> for Text-based Search

Our formative study findings reveal that the visual search process is inefficient due to the user's vague text query at the initial text-based search. To address this, we propose a <span class="sys-name">Query Concretization</span> interaction using LLM prompting in the visual search process.

### <span id="IM" class="sys-name">Image-based Image Modification</span> for Image-based Search

When users had concrete target images they wanted to look for in their minds, they wanted to use image modality to edit the following search queries in the image-based search. To support the user in finding a more intent-aligned search result, we propose <span class="sys-name">Image-based Image Modification</span> for the following visual search query.

<br/>

### <span id="KM" class="sys-name">Keyword-based Image Modification</span> for Image-based Search

One of the essential aspects of visual search is finding diversified and unexpected ideas as well as searching intent-aligned images. Our formative findings identified that the users tried to use text modality when they wanted to see more diversified and different images. Thus, we propose <span class="sys-name">Text-based Image Modification</span> interaction to help the divergent visual search phase.
